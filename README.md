# TTC Delay Prediction


In this project, we attempted to gain insight into the cause of TTCâ€™s transit delays in 2024 using numerous machine learning techniques. In addition, our model also allows user to input the desired features to get a prediction of delay.

## Detail

- Programming Language: Python (Version 3.12)
- Package Requirements: Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Xgboost


## Files
-	Streetcar_Duration.py: the model for streetcar delay. 
-	Bus_Duration.py: the model for bus delay.
-	Streetcar_grid_search.py, bus_grid_search.py: search for the best learning rate and L2 regularization for Duration.py and Bus_Duration.py, respectively (Warning: these files could take several minutes to execute). 


## Example Usage
-	Note: Please change the data path to the correct location of the dataset files.
-	A user may want to know the potential delay of line 504 on Wednesday. The streetcar is planned to arrive at 18:00 3 minutes after the previous car and they expect a general delay of the car.  To get the prediction, at the sample user input in Streetcar_Duration.py, input:
	user_input = {
    'Date': ['03-Jan-24'],
    'Line': ['504'],
    'Time': ['18:00'],
    'Day': ['Wednesday'],
    'Incident': ['General Delay'],
    'Min Gap': '3',
    'Bound': ['']
}
which will return the delay prediction. 

-	Similarly, if a user wants to know the potential delay of bus 89 on Sunday. The bus is planned to arrive at 18:00 3 minutes after the previous car and they expect a general delay of the car.  To get the prediction, at the sample user input in Bus_Duration.py, input:
	user_input = {
    'Date': ['06-Jan-24'],
    'Route': ['89'],
    'Time': ['18:00'],
    'Day': ['Sunday'],
    'Incident': ['Security'],
    'Min Gap': '3',
}
